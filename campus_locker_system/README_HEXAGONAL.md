# Hexagonal Architecture Migration Plan

This document describes the migration of the Campus Locker System to a hexagonal (ports and adapters) monolith architecture.

## New Directory Structure

```
campus_locker_system/
  app/
    presentation/      # Web/API routes, templates
    services/          # Application orchestration (new, will move orchestration here)
    business/          # Domain models, business rules (new, will move models/rules here)
    persistence/       # DB models, repo interfaces/adapters
    adapters/          # External adapters (mail, etc. - new)
    config.py
    __init__.py
    ...
  database/            # Migrations, schema (if needed)
  tests/
  docker-compose.yml
  README.md
  README_HEXAGONAL.md
```

## Migration Phases

1. **Skeleton:** Create new folders and README (this file). No code moved yet.
2. **Domain Extraction:** Move code into `business/`, `services/`, and update imports. Test after each move.
3. **Adapters:** Move external system logic (mail, etc.) to `adapters/`.
4. **Persistence:** Refine repository interfaces and adapters in `persistence/`.
5. **Testing:** Ensure all tests pass after each phase.

## Migration Progress

### âœ… COMPLETED
- **Phase 1**: Repository skeleton with hexagonal folder structure
- **Phase 2**: Domain extraction (6/6 domains completed) 
  - Parcel Management Domain âœ…
  - Locker Management Domain âœ…  
  - PIN Management Domain âœ…
  - Notification (Email) Management Domain âœ…
  - Admin & Auth Management Domain âœ…
  - Audit Logging Management Domain âœ…
  - All functions moved from `app/application/services.py` to appropriate domain services âœ…
- **Phase 3**: Adapter implementation (3/3 adapters completed) âœ…
  - Email Adapter (Flask-Mail abstraction) âœ…
  - Database Adapter (SQLAlchemy abstraction) âœ…
  - Audit Adapter (Audit logging abstraction) âœ…
  - Clean interfaces with mock implementations for testing âœ…
  - Factory functions for automatic adapter selection âœ…

### ðŸ”„ READY FOR NEXT PHASE
- **Phase 4**: CI & tests refinement

### ðŸ“‹ REMAINING
- **Phase 4**: CI & tests refinement
- **Phase 5**: Review & staging

## Test Status
- **Current**: 91/91 tests passing (100% success rate)
- **Architecture**: Clean hexagonal architecture with external system abstractions
- **Migration**: âœ… Phase 3 COMPLETE - All adapters implemented with clean interfaces!

## Notes
- The original `README.md` is preserved for legacy documentation and onboarding.
- This migration is incremental and tested at each step.
