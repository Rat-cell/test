```
ImportError: cannot import name 'reissue_pin' from 'app.services.pin_service'
AttributeError: 'NotificationManager' has no attribute 'create_parcel_deposit_email'
```
- **Root Cause**: API changes not reflected in test modules
- **Impact**: FR01, FR02, FR04, FR05, FR07 test suites
- **Solution**: Update import statements and method calls
