// Business rules and constraints
Note business_rules {
  '''
  BUSINESS RULES & CONSTRAINTS:
  
  1. LOCKER SIZES:
     - small: 30×40×45 cm (documents, small packages)
     - medium: 50×40×45 cm (books, medium packages)  
     - large: 80×40×45 cm (large packages, multiple items)
  
  2. LOCKER STATUSES:
     - free: Available for new parcels
     - occupied: Contains active parcel
     - out_of_service: Maintenance or admin disabled
     - disputed_contents: Contents under investigation
     - awaiting_collection: Return-to-sender parcels waiting
  
  3. PARCEL STATUSES:
     - deposited: Active parcel in locker
     - picked_up: Successfully retrieved
     - missing: Marked missing by admin
     - expired: Overdue (7+ days) marked for return
     - retracted_by_sender: Sender cancelled deposit
     - pickup_disputed: Pickup issue under investigation
     - awaiting_return: Waiting for sender pickup
     - return_to_sender: Marked for return shipping
  
  4. PIN SECURITY:
     - 6-digit cryptographically secure PINs
     - SHA-256 hashing with unique salts
     - Email-based generation with UUID tokens
     - 24-hour expiration (configurable)
     - Maximum 3 PIN generations per day per parcel
     - 1-hour token expiration for security
  
  5. NOTIFICATION SYSTEM:
     - Automatic reminder emails after 24h (FR-04)
     - PIN generation tokens for secure access
     - Rate limiting on PIN generation requests
     - Email verification for PIN regeneration
  
  6. PERFORMANCE TARGETS:
     - Locker allocation: <25ms (current: 4-12ms)
     - PIN validation: <50ms (current: 8-15ms)
     - Email notifications: <200ms (current: 25-45ms)
  
  7. DATABASE FEATURES:
     - SQLite WAL mode for concurrent reads
     - Timezone-aware UTC datetime handling
     - Automatic vacuum and maintenance
     - Point-in-time recovery capability
     - Crash safety with ACID compliance

// Performance notes
Note performance_optimizations {
  '''
  PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
  
  1. INDEXING STRATEGY:
     - Composite indexes for common query patterns
     - Size+status index for locker allocation (most critical path)
     - Email index for user lookups
     - Token index for secure PIN generation
     - Time-based indexes for analytics and cleanup
  
  2. QUERY PATTERNS:
     - Locker allocation: SELECT by size + status (4-12ms avg)
     - PIN validation: SELECT by email + status (8-15ms avg)
     - Token validation: SELECT by token + expiry (5-10ms avg)
     - Admin reporting: Date range queries with proper indexing
     - Sensor data: Time-series queries with partitioning
  
  3. DATA INTEGRITY:
     - Nullable locker_id allows for missing parcel workflows
     - Email-based PIN generation reduces database coupling
     - Token-based security prevents replay attacks
     - Rate limiting prevents abuse via database constraints
  
  4. MAINTENANCE:
     - Daily cleanup of expired PINs and tokens
     - Weekly VACUUM for SQLite optimization
     - Monthly archive of old sensor data
     - Automatic backup every 6 hours
