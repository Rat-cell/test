# üìã Campus Locker System - Changelog

## [2.1.9] - 2025-05-31

### üèõÔ∏è Architectural Refactoring - Hexagonal Architecture Implementation

To enhance modularity, testability, and long-term maintainability, the application underwent a significant refactoring to align with Hexagonal Architecture principles. This involved a clear separation of concerns, with business logic at the core, surrounded by application services and infrastructure adapters.

#### **Key Changes:**
- **Implemented Repository Pattern**: Database interactions have been abstracted into dedicated repository classes, decoupling services and business logic from direct data persistence mechanisms.
  - Created `AdminUserRepository` for admin user data.
  - Created `LockerRepository` for locker data.
  - Created `ParcelRepository` for parcel data.
  - Created `AuditLogRepository` for audit log data.
  - Created `LockerSensorDataRepository` for locker sensor data.
- **Service Layer Refactoring**: Core services were updated to utilize the new repository layer for all data operations. This includes:
  - `AdminAuthService`
  - `ParcelService`
  - `PinService`
  - `LockerService`
  - `AuditService`
  - `DatabaseService`
  - `LockerConfigurationService`
- **Business Logic Refactoring**: Core business logic classes (`LockerManager`, `ParcelManager`) were also refactored to delegate data persistence through repositories.
- **Centralized Data Models**: SQLAlchemy model definitions (e.g., `Locker`, `Parcel`) were consolidated from various business layer files into a central `app/persistence/models.py`.
- **Adapter Streamlining**: Removed redundant adapter classes (e.g., `SQLAlchemyAuditAdapter`, `SQLAlchemyAdapter`) as their responsibilities are now handled by the repository layer and direct service interactions where appropriate.
- **Test Suite Adaptation**: Test files were updated to align with the new architecture. Tests now primarily interact with the service layer or repositories, rather than making direct database calls (e.g., `db.session.commit()`, `Model.query`), ensuring tests are focused on business rules and service contracts.

#### **Impact & Benefits:**
- **Improved Modularity**: Clearer boundaries between application layers.
- **Enhanced Testability**: Easier to mock dependencies (like repositories) for unit and integration testing.
- **Increased Maintainability**: Changes in one area (e.g., database technology) are less likely to impact other parts of the application.
- **Decoupled Business Logic**: Core domain logic is independent of infrastructure concerns.
