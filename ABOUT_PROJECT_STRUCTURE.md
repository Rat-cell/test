# 📂 Project Structure Guide - Campus Locker System v2.1.3

This document explains what each file and folder in our project does and why we need it. It's written for people who are new to coding or want to understand how our project is organized.

## 🎯 What is this project?

The Campus Locker System is a web application that helps manage package deliveries on campus. Think of it like a smart mailbox system where people can drop off and pick up packages using special codes. Version 2.1.3 is production-ready with 15 pre-configured lockers and safety-first architecture!

## 📁 Main Application Directory (`campus_locker_system/`)

This folder contains all the actual code that makes our app work.

### 🐍 Python Files

#### `run.py`
- **What it is**: The "start button" for our application
- **Why we need it**: This file actually starts the web server
- **Think of it as**: The ignition key of a car

#### `requirements.txt`
- **What it is**: A shopping list of all the Python libraries our app needs
- **Why we need it**: Tells Python what extra tools to download
- **Example**: Like needing specific ingredients to bake a cake

#### `create_admin.py`
- **What it is**: A helper script to create administrator accounts

- **Why we need it**: Like the settings menu on your phone - controls how everything works
- **Contains**: Database connections, email settings, security keys

### 🏗️ Application Structure (`app/` folder)

Our app follows a special pattern called "Hexagonal Architecture." Think of it like organizing a house into different rooms for different purposes. This architecture helps keep the core business rules separate from external concerns like the database or user interface, making the system more flexible and easier to test.

#### `📁 presentation/`
- **What it is**: The "face" of our application - what users see and interact with (e.g., web pages, API endpoints).
- **Why we need it**: Handles incoming requests and outgoing responses, translating them for the application services.
- **Think of it as**: The storefront of a shop or the reception desk - where customers interact and make requests.

#### `📁 business/`
- **What it is**: The "brain" of our application - where all the important decisions and core domain logic reside.
- **Why we need it**: Contains the essential rules and processes of our locker system, independent of how data is stored or displayed.
- **Think of it as**: The manager's office combined with the core operational workflows - where the fundamental business policies and logic are defined and executed.

#### `📁 services/`
- **What it is**: Application services that orchestrate use cases and coordinate business logic with data persistence.
- **Why we need it**: Acts as an intermediary between the presentation layer and the business logic/persistence layers. They define the available operations and manage transactions.
- **Think of it as**: Specialized department heads who manage specific workflows, using the core business rules and delegating data tasks to the persistence layer.

#### `📁 persistence/`
- **What it is**: Responsible for all data storage and retrieval operations.
- **Why we need it**: Provides an abstraction over the database, allowing the rest of the application to be database-agnostic. It remembers information even when the app is turned off.
- **Contains**:
    - `models.py`: Centralized SQLAlchemy data model definitions (the blueprint of our data).
    - `repositories/`: A subdirectory containing repository classes (e.g., `LockerRepository`, `ParcelRepository`). Each repository implements the actual data access logic (CRUD operations) for its associated model, hiding the specific database technology (SQLite in this case) from the services and business logic.
- **Think of it as**: The secure records room and archive, with librarians (repositories) who know exactly how to find and store information (models).

#### `📁 adapters/`
- **What it is**: Connects our application to external systems or translates data for external concerns. This is where the "ports and adapters" concept of Hexagonal Architecture becomes very clear.
- **Why we need it**: Allows our core application to remain independent of specific external tools or interfaces. For example, an adapter might handle sending emails via a specific email service, or fetching data from an external API.
- **What it might contain**: Adapters for email notifications, payment gateways (if any), or other third-party service integrations. Some previous adapters (like direct SQLAlchemy adapters) have been streamlined or removed as repositories now handle direct data persistence concerns.
- **Think of it as**: Specialized translators and connectors that allow our application to interact with the outside world (e.g., a mail service adapter, a UI adapter if the presentation layer itself is considered an adapter).

### 🗄️ Data Storage - Enhanced in v2.1.3

#### `📁 databases/` ⭐ **IMPROVED**
- **What it is**: Where all our data is stored (user accounts, locker information, etc.)
- **Why we need it**: The app needs to remember things between sessions
- **Think of it as**: A digital filing cabinet that never forgets
- **New in v2.1.3**: 
  - **Fixed volume configuration**: Database files now properly stored on host filesystem
  - **15 Pre-configured HWR lockers**: Ready for production use (5 small, 5 medium, 5 large)
  - **Dual-database architecture**: Main database + audit trail database
  - **Automatic backups**: Safety-first architecture with backup protection
  - **Configuration persistence**: `lockers-hwr.json` with production locker setup

#### `📁 logs/`
- **What it is**: A diary of everything that happens in the app
- **Why we need it**: Helps us debug problems and understand how the app is being used
- **Think of it as**: Security camera footage - helps investigate issues

### 🧪 Testing - Enhanced in v2.1.3

#### `📁 tests/` ⭐ **IMPROVED**
- **What it is**: Code that tests our main code to make sure it works correctly
- **Why we need it**: Catches bugs before users find them
- **Think of it as**: Quality control in a factory
- **New in v2.1.3**:
  - **91 comprehensive tests**: All passing with complete coverage
  - **6-step deployment flow test**: Validates complete deployment process
  - **Edge case testing**: Enhanced locker overwrite protection testing
  - **Organized structure**: `flow/` for deployment tests, `edge_cases/` for boundary testing

#### `pytest.ini`
- **What it is**: Configuration file for our testing system
- **Why we need it**: Tells the testing system how to run our tests
- **Contains**: Test settings and preferences

### 🐳 Containerization

#### `Dockerfile`
- **What it is**: Instructions for building a "container" (isolated environment) for our app
- **Why we need it**: Ensures the app runs the same way on every computer
- **Production ready**: Optimized for real use with Gunicorn and security hardening

### `📁 docs/`
Contains detailed documentation and diagrams

#### `C4_DIAGRAMS_README.md`
- **What it is**: Explains the visual diagrams of our app's architecture
- **Why we need it**: Helps developers understand how different parts connect
- **Think of it as**: Blueprints for a building

#### `c4-diagrams.puml`
- **What it is**: The actual diagram code that creates visual representations
- **Why we need it**: Creates pictures that are easier to understand than text

### `📁 venv/`
- **What it is**: A separate Python environment just for this project
- **Why we need it**: Keeps our project's dependencies separate from other projects
- **Think of it as**: A private workshop with only the tools you need for this project

### `📁 ssl/`

## 🔄 How Everything Works Together - v2.1.3 Architecture

1. **User visits the website** → Nginx receives the request
2. **Nginx forwards the request** → To our Flask application (Gunicorn WSGI server)
3. **Flask app processes the request** → Using business logic and safety checks
4. **If data is needed** → Persistence layer talks to the dual-database system
5. **Safety features activate** → Automatic backups and conflict detection
6. **Response is sent back** → Through the same chain, but in reverse
7. **Everything is logged** → To both application logs and audit database
8. **Performance optimized** → Redis caching and multi-worker deployment

## 🛡️ Safety-First Architecture - New in v2.1.3

Our system now includes comprehensive safety features:

- **🚫 No Accidental Data Loss**: Multiple safety mechanisms prevent overwriting existing locker data
- **💾 Automatic Backups**: Every data-changing operation creates timestamped backups
- **🔒 Conflict Detection**: System blocks operations that would corrupt existing data
- **🌱 Add-Only Mode**: Safely add new lockers without touching existing ones
- **💥 Admin-Reset Mode**: Requires multiple confirmations for destructive operations
