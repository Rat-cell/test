## 🔄 How Everything Works Together - v2.1.3 Architecture

1. **User visits the website** → Nginx receives the request
2. **Nginx forwards the request** → To our Flask application (Gunicorn WSGI server)
3. **Flask app processes the request** → Using business logic and safety checks
4. **If data is needed** → Persistence layer talks to the dual-database system
5. **Safety features activate** → Automatic backups and conflict detection
6. **Response is sent back** → Through the same chain, but in reverse
7. **Everything is logged** → To both application logs and audit database
8. **Performance optimized** → Redis caching and multi-worker deployment

## 🛡️ Safety-First Architecture - New in v2.1.3

Our system now includes comprehensive safety features:

- **🚫 No Accidental Data Loss**: Multiple safety mechanisms prevent overwriting existing locker data
- **💾 Automatic Backups**: Every data-changing operation creates timestamped backups
- **🔒 Conflict Detection**: System blocks operations that would corrupt existing data
- **🌱 Add-Only Mode**: Safely add new lockers without touching existing ones
- **💥 Admin-Reset Mode**: Requires multiple confirmations for destructive operations
